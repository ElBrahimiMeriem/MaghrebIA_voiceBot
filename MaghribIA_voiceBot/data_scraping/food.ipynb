      "Numerous tiny, light, tender grains, ideally arranged to form a pyramid and served on a platter at the end of a meal - that is couscous, the national dish of Morocco and Algeria and a must-have dish in any Moroccan and Algerian restaurant. The word itself refers both to the complete dish and the tiny grains of semolina.Semolina flour is sprinkled with water until it forms into tiny pellets that are then pushed through a sieve. Couscous is usually prepared on Fridays for lunch, when whole families get together for the most important meal of the week. The dish is traditionally made in a metal steamer pot called a couscoussier, where the stew is on the bottom, while the small grains are in the perforated basket on top, cooking in the steam that is rising from the rich stew.Although couscous dishes are often full of vegetables, they are rarely vegetarian.  Read more Some classics include couscous with seven vegetables and couscous with raisins and caramelized onions, but there are many more varieties such as spicy with chili peppers, sweet with chickpeas, lamb and raisins, Berber-style with chicken, milk and turnips, or fish couscous with fish, fennel stalks, and wild turnips.There is even a dessert couscous dish served with butter and enhanced with cinnamon and sugar. After couscous is served, it is covered with meat or fish and vegetables, while the broth from the same stew is served on the side, for the ones who want to ladle some on top of the grains.However, don't be mistaken - it is not the main course, as it is served at the end of a long string of courses to totally satiate the consumer, as the popular Arabian hospitality saying goes - \"No guest should go home hungry\".\n",

      "Link: https://www.tasteatlas.com/tajine\n",
      "Tajine, also known as tagine, refers both to the rich Moroccan stews and the cooking vessel used to make them. When referring to the cooking vessel, it is a round and shallow, clay or ceramic casserole with a tall, pointy, conical lid.The same lid fits into the base, so the steam condenses on its interior and drops back into the stew without any waste of flavors and moisture. The pots are ideal for slow cooking over embers or on a stove, resulting in buttery, tender vegetables and meat that falls off the bone.Tajines can be glazed or unglazed - the unglazed ones are earthier and darken over time, while the glazed ones are recommended for people who cook infrequently. There are also serving tajines, which are usually decorated and lighter than the other tajines, but they're not resistant to heat.  Read more In the area of Rif Mountains, there's tagra, an unglazed tajine with little clay handles and without a lid. A Berber tajine is known as chalhaoui, and it has a rounded, dome-shaped lid instead of the conical one. Tajines show Moroccan cuisine's affinity for combining different textures and mixing flavors, such as a well-balanced blend of savory and sweet, for example, chicken with tomato and almonds, and veal cuts with stewed, sliced pears.Baby artichokes, spring peas, and various nuts such as almonds or pistachios are a common ingredient in tajines. These dishes are often accompanied by couscous, steamed rice, or fresh, hot bread, and the varieties are virtually limitless – from seafood tajines with mussels and tomato sauce, to lamb tajines with vegetables such as onions, carrots, potatoes, and olives, fruits such as apricots and raisins, and lots of spices such as red and black pepper, cumin, saffron, and turmeric, tajines are a national dish full of creativity and flavour.\n",

It's the most popular soup in Morocco, symbolizing the unification of people during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting in the Muslim calendar.According to religious law, practitioners may not eat or drink anything between dawn and sunset. At sunset, when the cannons strike, Moroccans eat their first meal of the day - the obligatory harira soup, accompanied by dates, figs, coffee, or milk, along with fried honey cookies shaped like flowers and sprinkled with sesame, called chebakia.Harira is made from a variety of legumes such as lentils, fava beans, and chickpeas, tomato sauce, harissa paste, and fresh herbs such as parsley, turmeric, saffron, lemon, caraway seeds, and coriander, but every region in Morocco has its own version of the soup.  Read more It's also very popular in Algeria. Harira can be either vegetarian or stuffed with bits of lamb, chicken, beef, or fish meat. In some cases, beaten eggs or flour and water mixture are whisked into the soup near the end of cooking in order to give it a slightly different texture and to thicken it.Spicy, peppery, nourishing, rich with vegetables and meat, harira is a true delicacy in the world of soups.\n",

The consistency of the sauce and eggs is also variable – the sauce can be thinner or thicker, while the eggs can be completely firm or soft.For a more nutritious meal, meat, most commonly sausages, can be included in the dish.

When baked, the pastry is often dusted with powdered sugar or brushed with warm honey.It is recommended to garnish the snake cake with sliced or ground almonds and pair it with a cup of sweet mint tea.\n",

Fried almonds and hard-boiled eggs are welcome, but optional additions.The name medfouna means buried, referring to the ingredients that are buried or hidden in the flatbread dough.

Well adapted to the harsh environment, surviving extreme heat and thriving in the barren soil, the endemic argan trees are traditionally grown in the Sous savanna valley.Each part of this diverse tree is usable: the fruits are edible, its precious oil can be extracted from the nuts and the wood is typically used for fuel. Argan fruit has a thick, bitter peel surrounding its fragrant pulp and nut, inside which there are one to three oil-rich kernels. If the argan oil is to be used for cooking, the kernels are roasted before being crushed, to bring out the flavor.Producing argan oil is a difficult process done by Moroccan Berber women using traditional knowledge. They work in cooperatives such as the Amal Cooperative in Tamanar and the Tifaout Women’s Agricultural Cooperative in the Souss-Massa-Drâa region. To produce just one liter of argan oil, it takes approximately twenty kilograms of argan fruit and almost twenty hours of work.  Read more The country is famous for its tree-climbing goats who eat argan fruit and leaves, excreting the undigestable seeds in the process, which are then traditionally collected and processed, although in modern times argan oil is often manufactured by hand.Therefore, this is one of the rarest oils on the market, but also one of the best quality.

Although it is quite inexpensive when purchased and sold locally, this highly sought-after spice becomes a luxury food item as it reaches big markets in the country and Europe.In Taliouine, apart from using the spice in traditional Moroccan specialties, the local population typically adds saffron to their tea to warm themselves up and prevent disease in winter.\n",

      "Produced by local women in the eponymous Moroccan village, set at the foothills of the eastern Anti-Atlas mountain range, Alnif cumin is traditionally gathered and processed from the end of April till the beginning of May. Bunches of hand-cut cumin plants are first dried, then beaten to extract the seeds, and finally sieved through a palm-leaf-woven container to filter out fine straw and dust.Distinguished by excellent quality and intense aroma, this cumin variety can be used both whole and ground, and it commonly enhances the flavor of various traditional Moroccan specialties such as couscous, tajine, and soups. Alnif cumin also goes well in combination with boiled meat and vegetables and is highly appreciated for its curative properties and for having a relatively long shelf life.\n",

      "Zerradoun salt is a variety of salt that is traditionally produced by local women from the Al Wifak cooperative in Zerradoun, a village located at the foothills of the Rif Mountains in northeastern Morocco. The salt comes from two natural sources of saline water in the village, where it has been harvested from 200-year-old salt pans according to age-old methods with only slight changes which have been introduced in recent years.Beginning from mid-May, the salt is being extracted through a process of evaporation and drying in tanks or pans, which typically lasts up to a week. The salt crystals are primarily processed into crystalline salt that is characterized by good quality and excellent flavor.Although kitchen salt is the main product of the salt production, Zerradoun salt crystals are nowadays also used to make a variety of cosmetic products such as scented bath salts and exfoliating scrubs.\n",

The consummation of mint tea is common to the Maghrebi region of North Africa, but it is strongly associated with Morocco.It is traditionally prepared in berrad teapots, in which the tea is first steeped to produce the so-called spirit that is saved for later use. The leaves are washed and are then brewed with the addition of the tea spirit and water.Optionally, other types of herbs can be used instead of spearmint, and they can be put inside the teapot or directly into cups. In Morocco, Maghrebi tea is associated with social gatherings and is the ultimate sign of hospitality.\n",
