      "Q: Top 5 Things to See and Do in Morocco\n",
      "A: Spend some time in the Djemaa el-Fna, where you can find exotic street performers, tattoo artists, musicians, and chefs. After that, wander around the medina, explore the souks, eat in the market, see the old city, and enjoy Morocco’s most international city. Marrakesh has it all.\n",
      "The Sahara is vast, empty, and spectacular. Spending the night in a simple tent on the dunes was my favorite activity while in the country and I highly recommend you try it too. The stars go on forever and there’s no light pollution to block them out. (Skip the camel ride, though!)\n",
      "Chefchaouen is a small city located in the middle of the Rif Mountains. It is very relaxed, offers reasonable accommodations, and is visually stunning as the streets and buildings are all painted a vibrant sky blue (you’ve probably seen it on Instagram). It’s a great place to wander, shop, and sip mint tea.\n",
      "This old and powerful city is one of the best places in the country. Its narrow streets are filled with wonderful aromas, mosques, craft shops, and crowds upon crowds of people. Though Fez can be a bit overwhelming, once you get used to the pace of the city, it’s simply magical.\n",
      "A hammam is a steam bath popular in North Africa. They are usually found near mosques or toiletry shops and can be upscale or public (traditional). Visit a no-frills traditional bath for an authentic and enlightening experience. Public hammams cost about 10 MAD, while hotel hammams cost 300-500 MAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Other Things to See and Do in Morocco\n",
      "A: The medinas are the historic hearts of each city in Morocco, part residential area, part shopping center, part food market. Shops, restaurants, markets, and homes all line the twisting and turning streets in buildings seemingly too close together and too old to stay up much longer. As someone who loves to get lost, the medinas were heaven. Word of caution: The Fez Medina is a bit unsafe, so do not go too far off the beaten path. Stick to streets with lots of people or hire a guide to show you around.\n",
      "The rugged and beautiful Atlas Mountains stretch over 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), from the West Coast of Morocco all the way to Tunisia. This mountain range is home to Jebel Toubkal, North Africa’s tallest peak at 13,671 feet. You can hike all year round, but the best time is from April to May. The Toubkal Circuit (7 days) and M’Goun Traverse (3 days) are some of the more popular treks.\n",
      "Located near Tinerhir in the High Atlas Mountains, this gorge is one of the most recognized in the world and has become very popular with travelers looking to hike the canyon. It’s a challenging hike and takes around 4 hours but if you’re looking for something truly different and outdoorsy in Morocco, don’t miss out on this. For an even more unique experience, skip the day trip and stay overnight in the nearby village of Ait Baha.\n",
      "The Hassan II Mosque, located in Casablanca, is a huge mosque with a minaret that stands 60 stories. It’s the second-largest mosque in Africa and the seventh-largest in the world. The walls are made of marble and the roof is retractable (the minaret also has a laser that points to Mecca at night). It took thousands of Moroccan artists a total of five years to build this detailed architectural masterpiece. Its mosaics, plaster moldings, marble and stone columns and floors, and wood ceilings are utterly impressive. It is big enough for 105,000 worshipers! Combined entry to the mosque and museum is 140 MAD.\n",
      "Traditional Moroccan food is a blend of Berber, Arabic, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and French cuisine. Many hotels and guesthouses offer cooking classes in the big cities like Marrakesh and Fez. You can buy fresh produce from the local market and then make a traditional dish. Café Clock offers some of the best classes. With locations in Marrakesh, Chefchaouen, and Fez, this Western-influenced café is famous for its gigantic and delicious camel burger (which tastes a lot like spicy shawarma).\n",
      "Located in Rabat, this 12th-century Kasbah is found in the oldest part of the city. The citadel, with its narrow streets of white houses, and a great place to wander around and take some pictures. Its elevation offers beautiful views of the river and ocean.\n",
      "Morocco is extremely popular among surfers. The best time to go is during the winter months when the waves are bigger and more consistent, and the air and water temperature is mild. Head to Taghazout, the most popular surf town, to catch some of the best surf in the country. A week-long stay at a surf camp, including lessons, equipment, accommodation, and airport transfer costs around 5,000 MAD.\n",
      "This major city in northern Morocco is located on the North African coast at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The city’s location means that many civilizations and cultures have left their mark on Tangiers since at least the 10th century BCE. From 1924-1956, Tangier was an international zone separate from Morocco, and thus became a destination for many European and American diplomats, businessmen, writers, and spies during this time. Don’t miss the Grand Mosque, the Kasbah, and strolling down the beach promenade.\n",
      "Named for its proximity to the Atlas Mountains, Atlas Film Studios in the city of Ouarzazate is the largest film studio in the world, covering more than 322,000 sq ft of the desert. Many big films have been shot here including: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), Gladiator (2000), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Hanna (2011), and part of the TV series Game of Thrones. Be sure to visit the nearby Ksar of Aït Benhaddou kasbah too! It plays into what people think a ksar (fortified village) should look like. I enjoyed roaming the streets and climbing to the top for the view.\n",
      "A major trading center and the southernmost settlement during Roman times, Volubilis is one of the best-preserved (and least frequented) such ruins in the world. It originally dates to the 3rd century BCE and became the capital of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania, growing even more during Roman rule. I found it empty of tourists, not built up, and open in a way that lets you see the structures up close without being behind ten feet of barriers and jostled by crowds. Most of the city is still unexcavated so the site has a very “Indiana Jones” feel to it. I’ve been to a lot of Roman ruins in my travels, but this one is my favorite. Admission is 70 MAD.\n",
      "Pleasantly stroll the Medina in Meknes without being pestered. Located in Central Morocco, this authentic market sells handicrafts made in Meknes such as embroidery and Meknes “Damascene” ironwork. If the Medinas of Fez and Marrakesh overwhelm you, this is the place to go.\n",
      "Essaouira is located a few hours from Marrakesh on the Atlantic coast and is a popular beach destination for tourists, especially Brits. I loved the relaxed atmosphere of the city, the lack of pushy touts, the sea air, and all the fresh fish. Be sure to visit the wonderful fish market in town, where all the small fishermen sell their day’s catch. Afterward, check out the small fish stalls nearby in the main square where you can enjoy fresh, grilled seafood for cheap.\n",
      "For more information on specific destinations in Morocco, check out these guides:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Morocco Travel Costs\n",
      "A: Accommodation – Dorm rooms with 6-8 beds cost between 80-110 MAD per night in the big cities like Marrakesh and Fez, and about 50-60 MAD in smaller places. Private rooms in hostels cost around 260-380 MAD. Free Wi-Fi is standard and many hostels also include free breakfast.\n",
      "Budget hotels in Marrakesh and Fez cost around 270-410 MAD per night for a double room. Expect basic amenities like free Wi-Fi, TV, free breakfast, and sometimes even an outdoor pool.\n",
      "Wild camping is legal in Morocco for those traveling with a tent. Locals usually don’t like people camping on or near their property, however, so only take advantage of this if you’re not going to disturb anyone. Don’t be surprised if nomads or police stop by to check on you.\n",
      "Food – Moroccan cuisine is a colorful, flavorful mix of Berber, Andalusian, and Mediterranean traditions with a pinch of French and sub-Saharan cuisine to round things out. It is a land of spices, so expect flavorful meals at every turn (the traditional ras el hanout spice mix is composed of 27 different spices). Beef, goat, and lamb are some of the most common meats, usually eaten with couscous. Fish like mackerel and anchovy are also quite common, owing to the country’s location on the coast. Be sure to try pastilla, a pastry filled with meat or seafood.\n",
      "Eating in Morocco can be extremely cheap, especially if you eat at the many markets. A pot of mint tea costs between 8-10 MAD. Indulge in local food, including the popular tagine, a meat and vegetables dish for about 35-55 MAD. Sandwiches, pizza, and most other dishes range between 30-50 MAD.\n",
      "A fish dish in coastal cities like Essaouira costs about 100-150 MAD while a lobster is about 350-400 MAD. Seafood dinners come with drinks, salad, and bread.\n",
      "For more touristy or Western restaurants, expect to spend at least 150 MAD or more per main dish.\n",
      "Beer and wine cost around 70 MAD for a drink (however, there aren’t that many opportunities to drink in Morocco, so I wouldn’t factor it much into your budget).\n",
      "There’s no need to buy groceries here as the food is cheap and it’s far easier to eat out! But if you do, expect to pay 200 MAD per week for groceries that include pasta, vegetables, chicken, and other basic staples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Backpacking Morocco Suggested Budgets\n",
      "A: On a backpacker’s budget expect to spend around 285 MAD per day. This assumes you’re staying in a hostel, eating at market stalls and cooking some meals, limiting your drinking (which is very easy to do here), using local transportation to get around, and sticking to free and cheap activities like free walking tours and public hammam visits.\n",
      "On a mid-range budget of 525 MAD per day, you can stay in a private Airbnb, eat out for all your meals, take the train between cities, and do more paid tours and activities like museum visits and camping in the Sahara.\n",
      "On a “luxury” budget of 1,120 MAD or more per day, you can stay in a hotel, eat out anywhere you want, enjoy a few drinks, fly between cities or hire a driver, and do whatever tours and activities you want. This is just the ground floor for luxury though. The sky is the limit!\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Morocco Travel Guide: Money-Saving Tips\n",
      "A: It doesn’t cost a lot of money to travel Morocco — though it’s also easy to splash out here if you want. Here are my tips for saving money in Morocco:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Where to Stay in Morocco\n",
      "A: Looking for a place to rest your head in Morocco? Here are some of my favorite places to stay in Morocco for your next visit:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Get Around Morocco\n",
      "A: Public transportation – Public transportation can be hit or miss in Morocco. The bigger cities, like Marrakesh and Casablanca, have public bus services, but the buses are old and overcrowded and the routes are hard to figure out.\n",
      "Instead, most people use petits taxis to get around town. These are small vehicles that can hold up to three people and are prevalent all over the country. They’re very cheap, although there may be a surcharge after 8pm. To ensure you get a fair fare, negotiate your price upfront.\n",
      "Metered taxis are also available in bigger cities like Marrakesh. Fares start around 7 MAD and then they charge 4 MAD per kilometer.\n",
      "Grand taxis – Grand taxis are shared taxis that can carry up to six passengers and are used to go longer distances between neighboring towns/cities. They won’t leave until the taxi is full but generally wait times aren’t so bad. You can locate one near just about any taxi stand or bus/train station. If you have a lot of luggage, you may have to pay extra. You should arrange your fare ahead of time.\n",
      "Bus – Intercity buses are a cheap and efficient way to get around Morocco, especially compared to other methods of transportation. The four most popular operators are:\n",
      "CTM and Supratours are the most reliable and have comfortable buses with air conditioning. You can book your tickets online or simply show up at the bus station. The websites aren’t terribly reliable or efficient to use. A 4-hour bus ride from Marrakesh to Casablanca is about 75-110 MAD, while a 6.5-hour ride from Marrakesh to Tangier is 260-275 MAD. Casablanca to Fez is 95-120 MAD.\n",
      "Train – Morocco’s national rail network is operated by ONCF and services some of the country’s major cities like Marrakesh, Casablanca, Rabat, Meknes, and Fez. The trains are comfortable and they’re usually on time, but disruptions do occasionally happen. There is now a high-speed rail running between Casablanca to Fez too. You can look up schedules and prices on ONCF.\n",
      "The 2.5-hour train trip from Marrakesh to Casablanca costs about 50 MAD, while the 4.5-hour journey from Marrakesh to Rabat starts around 150-180 MAD. Traveling from Casablanca to Fez takes 4 hours and is 50-120 MAD. The journey from Fez to Marrakesh takes 6.5 hours and costs 195 MAD.\n",
      "Flying – Royal Air Maroc is the main domestic airline, and they sometimes have good sales. An hour flight from Marrakesh to Casablanca starts at around 870 MAD, while a one-hour flight from Marrakesh to Fez starts at 520 MAD.\n",
      "Car rental – Car rental isn’t typically recommended in Morocco. Drivers are aggressive and accident rates are high! But if you want to venture off the beaten path, it’s a good way to go. You can find rentals starting from 200 MAD per day (sometimes cheaper).\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: When to Go to Morocco\n",
      "A: The best time to visit Morocco is during the country’s shoulder seasons, which run from April to May and September to November. The temperatures are nice and warm during this time and there is less tourist traffic. (However, this changes if you plan on spending most of your time surfing the coast or hiking the Atlas Mountains.)\n",
      "Summer lasts from June to August, and it can be ridiculously hot all over the country during this time — especially the further south you go (including in Marrakesh and Fez). A lot of people head to the coast to enjoy places like Tangier, Rabat, and Essaouira. Expect highs above 35°C (95°F).\n",
      "Winters (December-February) are mild, but it can get quite cold in the evenings. Temperatures drop as low as -3°C (27°F) in Marrakesh and the Atlas Mountains receive heavy snowfall. Winters in the north and along the coast are very wet. Overall, it’s not a great time to be here.\n",
      "The best time to go hiking in the Atlas Mountains is from April to May (spring) and September to October (fall). It’s mild during these months and there’s little risk of severe weather. Summer is the best time to enjoy the coast, where temperatures go as high as 27°C (80°F) but the ocean breeze offers plenty of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Stay Safe in Morocco\n",
      "A: Overall, Morocco is a safe destination but traveling here requires vigilance. You’re unlikely to ever be in any real physical danger in Morocco, but the petty crime and harassment require you to stay on guard — more so than in other countries.\n",
      "Women traveling alone attract a lot of attention here and the chances of being followed and possibly groped are high. This is a particular problem in crowded medinas. Always be watchful and trust your gut. Do not bring valuables with you and keep your belongings tight to your body. Dress conservatively and avoid wearing a lot of jewelry.\n",
      "Walking alone at night is generally not a good idea in the cities. If you’re unsure about an area, ask the hotel staff which areas are safe.\n",
      "If you need a taxi, always arrange the price in advance to avoid getting ripped off.\n",
      "When out and about, locals might invite you into their shops or offer to guide you around. Always politely but firmly decline otherwise you might end up getting ripped off.\n",
      "If you’re worried about getting scammed, you can read about common travel scams to avoid here.\n",
      "If you experience an emergency, dial 19 for assistance (112 for mobile phones).\n",
      "Always trust your gut instinct. If a taxi driver seems shady, stop the cab and get out. If your hotel is seedier than you thought, get out of there. Make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID. Forward your itinerary along to loved ones so they know where you are.\n",
      "For more in-depth coverage of how to stay safe in Morocco, check out this post that answers frequently asked questions and concerns.\n",
      "The most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past.

      "Question: 12 of the best things to do in Morocco\n",
      "Response: 1. Lose yourself in the medinas of Marrakesh, Fez and ChefchaouenThe fabled Red City of Marrakesh is a sensory overload of sights, sounds and smells. Its ancient medina is a maze of narrow streets with the Djemaa El Fna – arguably Africa’s most famous square – at its heart, and its nightly circus of storytellers, snake charmers and musicians.\n",
      "In Fez, Morocco’s oldest imperial city, time appears to have stopped. Dating back to the 8th century, Fez El Bali – the world’s largest living medieval medina – is a jumble of souqs, workshops and mosques, with a tangle of more than 9000 narrow alleyways to explore.\n",
      "Tucked into the green folds of the Rif Mountains, charming Chefchaouen is famed for its blue-hued medina. Soak up its relaxed pace of life by wandering its cobbled streets and sipping a mint tea in an open square, then hike the trails of Talassemtane National Park with its luminous waterfalls and forests of fir trees.\n",
      "Planning tip: The best time for exploring Morocco’s medinas is spring and autumn. Summers get very hot – temperatures can reach over 40°C (104°F) in July and August – and winters can be cold.\n",
      "2. Check out Casablanca’s show-stopping architectureCasablanca’s most iconic landmark is the Hassan II Mosque, one of the world’s largest mosques, open to non-Muslims on guided tours. The monumental prayer hall can hold 25,000 worshippers – another 80,000 can fit in the courtyards outside – and it showcases the finest Moroccan crafts, with hand-carved stucco, painted wood and stunning zellige (mosaic tilework).\n",
      "Downtown Casa is an al fresco museum of architecture, from the neo-Moorish tiled façade of La Grande Poste to art deco apartment blocks, and Place Mohammed V’s uber-modern Grand Théâtre de Casablanca designed by French \"starchitect\" Christian de Portzamparc.\n",
      "3. Hike the Atlas MountainsThe High Atlas is a hiker’s paradise, running diagonally across the country for around 1000km (620 miles), from the Atlantic coast to northern Algeria. Imlil, located in the foothills of the High Atlas 90 minutes from Marrakesh, is the jumping-off point for scaling Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak at 4167m (13670ft), a two-day ascent.\n",
      "If you have more time, the week-long Toubkal circuit follows centuries-old trails between remote Amazigh villages, crossing fertile valleys, rugged massifs and panoramic passes.\n",
      "For even less-trodden trails, the region around Tafraoute is Morocco’s Amazigh heartland, where tribes and traditions hold firm. Surrounded by lush palm groves and hilltop kasbahs, the Anti Atlas makes the perfect base for hikers – at 2359m (7740ft), Jebel El Kest is the region’s highest peak, but there are more gentle hiking and cycling routes passed the picturesque villages of the Ameln Valley.\n",
      "4. Catch the wind and waves on Morocco’s Atlantic coastDubbed the “Wind City of Africa” for its coastal breezes, Essaouira is the perfect spot to take to the water, whatever your ability. Sleepy Sidi Kaouki, 30 minutes' drive south, is another option, with consistent waves, wild beaches and wallet-friendly accommodation.\n",
      "Further down the coast, quiet Mirleft, 130km (80 miles) south of Agadir, is home to some of Morocco’s best surfing spots. Here Spot-M takes out experienced and novice surfers for group and individual lessons, and it runs week-long surf camps with yoga thrown in.\n",
      "Detour: Far-flung Dakhla is as south as it gets, but with reliable year-round wind conditions and calm lagoon waters, it’s being hailed as Morocco’s kitesurfing capital.\n",
      "5. Get steamed and scrubbed at a hammamAfter a long day of sightseeing, head to a hammam to be steamed, soaped, scrubbed and massaged into a state of total relaxation. Every neighborhood has one, and they come in all shapes, sizes and levels of luxury, from a simple steam and scrub at a no-frills public bathhouse to a higher-price private hammam at a swanky hotel with more elaborate wraps and massages on offer. Wherever you go, you’ll emerge squeaky clean with baby-soft skin.\n",
      "Planning tip: Pick up traditional hammam gear at the souq, including savon beldi (black soap), a kessa (course scrubbing mitt) and ghassoul (cleansing clay).\n",
      "Transform your visit to a Hammam by booking with GetYourGuide.\n",
      "6. Take a foodie tour of Fez medinaMoroccan cuisine is a genuine melting pot – alongside Amazigh (Berber) influences, Arabs, Moors, Ottoman Turks and French all left their culinary mark. One of the best ways to discover it is on a street-food tour. Fearless foodies sample everything from snail soup to boiled sheep’s head, plus tempting sweet treats such as chebakia (deep-fried dough coated in sesame seeds) and wild honey.\n",
      "Head to the legendary Café Clock to learn how to create three traditional dishes after souq shopping for super-fresh ingredients, or dive into the dough at The Ruined Garden, where you’ll bake five kinds of typical bread, including baghrir or “thousand-holes” pancake.\n",
      "Detour: In the Middle Atlas, you can also visit a boutique fromagerie, discover the age-old process of hand-rolling couscous and taste new Moroccan wine from a French enologist. Check out luxury tour outfit Plan-it Morocco for more.\n",
      "Explore the Fez Medina effortlessly with GetYourGuide. Book your tour today.\n",
      "7. Shop-til-you-drop in MarrakeshMarrakesh will satisfy the most insatiable shopaholic. The labyrinthine passageways of the souq are devoted to everything from aromatic spices to leather babouches (slippers) and shaggy wool rugs, with artisans weaving, hammering and carving out their wares as they’ve done for centuries. And now homegrown and international designers are working alongside them, giving age-old crafts a contemporary twist.\n",
      "The fixed-price boutiques of Gueliz (the French-built Ville Nouvelle) take away the hassle of haggling. Along the rue de la Liberté, Atika sells top-quality leather shoes for a fraction of the price of designer brands. And opposite the must-see Jardin Majorelle (the former home of Yves Saint Laurent), concept store 33 rue Majorelle stocks clothes, accessories and jewelry from top Moroccan designers, including fair trade cooperatives.\n",
      "Local tip: Don't begin negotiating on a price unless you genuinely want to buy something. Remain calm and courteous. If you feel under intense pressure to make a purchase, you can always walk away, but remember: for shopkeepers, this is their livelihood.\n",
      "8. Stargaze from a shape-shifting Saharan duneScramble to the summit of a sky-high dune at sunset and savor the silence and the stellar views as you watch the desert turn gold, pink and purple. Camp overnight Bedouin style and sleep under a blanket of stars. You might spot the arc of the Milky Way. At Erg Chigaga, you’re not only off the grid but also several hours' camel trek from the nearest street lights.\n",
      "Planning tips: Travel in the Sahara is best between October and early May. In the depths of the Saharan winter (especially December and January), overnight temperatures can fall below freezing. Almost unbearable heat blankets the Sahara from June to early September. Camel excursions head out from M’Hamid into the Erg Chigaga. From Merzouga, you can also take a 4WD trip out into Erg Chebbi. Both Merzouga and M’Hamid are a one-day bus ride from Marrakesh.\n",
      "9. Move to the rhythms at one of Morocco’s many music festivalsMorocco’s rich musical culture boasts influences from Amazigh to Andalusian, Arabian to sub-Saharan, and it’s fast becoming a top spot for music festivals showcasing eclectic rhythms.\n",
      "One of the most popular is the Gnaoua World Music Festival, which draws festival-goers to the laid-back coastal city of Essaouira for four days of open-air concerts featuring the hypnotic rhythms of gnaoua, a musical and spiritual tradition brought north by sub-Saharan enslaved people in the 16th century. Casablanca plays host to Jazzablanca, which showcases well-known and up-and-coming artists from Morocco and around the globe.\n",
      "Sufi chanters, African-American jazz saxophonists, Colombian harpists and international headliners like Björk flock to Fez for its annual Festival of World Sacred Music. Mawazine is said to be the world’s largest music festival, attracting a staggering 2.75 million people and turning Rabat into a gigantic open-air stage.\n",
      "Planning tip: If you’re heading to a festival, book your accommodation as far in advance as possible and be prepared for higher prices.\n",
      "10. Step back in time in Skoura’s palm oasesLike a green carpet spread on top of the red-tinged rocky landscape, Skoura’s idyllic palmeraie rustles with dates palms. With stylish guesthouses and farm-to-fork restaurants, it makes the perfect place to linger and enjoy the slower pace of oasis life.\n",
      "The region is dotted with labyrinthine ksar (fortified villages), including Ait Ben Haddou – a UNESCO World Heritage Site and star of many a film, including Gladiator (2000) – and imposing mud-brick kasbahs, such as the magical ruins of Kasbah Amridil. Rural souqs showcase the oases’ bountiful produce, including pomegranates, apricots, figs and almonds, and it makes a great base to explore the scenic Dadès Gorge and Todra Gorge to the northeast, and the Draa Valley to the southeast.\n",
      "11. Follow in the footsteps of literary giants in TangierFor the first half of the 20th century, Tangier was one of the Mediterranean’s most cosmopolitan resorts, an International Zone with a bohemian vibe beloved by the Beat Generation in the 1950s.\n",
      "A host of literary figures have taken their inspiration from this legendary port city over the years. William S. Burroughs penned Naked Lunch at the Hotel El-Muniria, where you can still take a mint tea on the terrace overlooking the Mediterranean. And Paul Bowles made Tangier his home for more than 50 years, using it as both subject and setting for The Sheltering Sky. Visit his exhibition at the Tangier American Legation Museum, then follow in his footsteps to Café Hafa overlooking the Straits of Gibraltar.\n",
      "You can find these authors and more in the historic bookstore Librarie des Colonnes, which opened its doors in 1949 and was frequented by the likes of Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote.\n",
      "12. Ride the rails on Africa’s first high-speed trainThe launch of Al Boraq – Africa’s first high-speed rail link named after a mythical winged steed – means you can visit Tangier on a day trip from Casablanca or combine the two very different coastal cities on a mini-break. The slick silver train will whizz you to your destination in just over two hours, hitting speeds of up to 320kmh (200mph), with stops in Rabat and Kenitra. And it’s eco-friendly, getting 25% of its power from renewable energy, with plans to extend this to 50% by the end of 2023.\n",
      "Planning tip: If the ONCF website still only takes Moroccan credit cards, you'll need to buy tickets at the station. Alternatively, you can go through an online retailer like Marrakech Tickets, who will add a small commission fee to the total.\n",

      "Q: Top 5 Things to See and Do in Fez\n",
      "A: This is where Fez began, back in the 8th century. Today, it is one of the most extensive and best-preserved historic towns in the world. The narrow streets are lined with skilled craftsmen and are bursting with exquisite aromas, crowds of people, and livestock running rampant.\n",
      "Fez is home to one of Africa’s largest mosques. It was established in 859, making it the oldest university in the world. In the 12th century, it was expanded to hold up to 20,000 people during prayer. Although non-Muslims cannot enter, visitors can admire its architectural design from several points overlooking the medina.\n",
      "Here workers dye skins and hides in little stone pools of various shades of pink, brown, white, and yellow. Getting into the tanning pits themselves is often impossible, but there are plenty of points to observe and watch the action. Each leather shop has a terrace with a view.\n",
      "Located 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Fez, this fertile agricultural grew rapidly under Roman rule and was a major olive oil producer. It’s a partly-excavated ruin now that hardly sees any tourists. In summer, the heat can be intense so bring a hat and water.\n",
      "Founded in the 14th-century by Abu Inan Faris, this madrasa (educational institute) is a perfect example of Moroccan artisanal skill. The intricate plaster and latticework of this structure are absolutely stunning. The green-tiled minaret and marble columns are quite impressive. Admission costs 20 MAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Other Things to See and Do in Fez\n",
      "A: Though the Royal Palace (Dar al-Makhzen) and gardens are closed to the public, the outside is still worth admiring. The palace was built in the 13th-century by Marinid sultans. A tunnel was constructed leading from the palace to the Grand Mosque, allowing the King to attend prayers in privacy. From Place des Alaouites, take a close look at the gilt bronze doors, and their giant artisan-made brass knockers.\n",
      "Recommended to me by many readers of the site, this Western-influenced café is famous for its gigantic camel burger (which tastes a lot like spicy shawarma). Beyond the burger, the food is excellent here: the burger, green smoothies, and melt-in-your-mouth buttery chicken couscous were so satisfying I ate here twice. And, in the crazy and chaotic medinas of each city, the café provides an oasis of calm, where you can recharge, use Wi-Fi, and cool down with air conditioning. They also offer cooking classes and host regular events. A five-hour class starts at 600 MAD and dishes at the café cost 25-95 MAD.\n",
      "The Al-Attarine Madrasa was designed as an annex to Kairaouine Mosque. The “school of the perfumers” was founded in 1325 by Abu Said and is located at the entrance of the spice and perfume market in Fez. The building is known to be one of the best examples of architecture from the Marinid period (13th-15th century), with a remarkable courtyard comprised of cedarwood and intricately carved plaster. Its mosaics, carvings, and impeccable detail make it worth the visit. Admission is 20 MAD.\n",
      "Jews have a long and complex history in Fez. During the city’s golden age between the 9th and 11th centuries, the Jewish community flourished. Afterward, Jews were expelled and killed. The Jewish Cemetery in Fez is one of the oldest in Morocco, home to thousands of tombs — all of which are stark white. The Habarim Synagogue, located at the far end of the property, is now home to a small museum of old articles, photos, and postcards.\n",
      "Built in the late 16th-century, this fort is one of the largest defensive structures in Fez. Today, the fort is known as the Museum of Arms, the first museum in Morocco that specializes in the history of arms. There are around 5,000 pieces in the museum’s collection, dating from prehistory to the 20th-century. Don’t miss the Saadian cannon, which was used during the Battle of the Three Kings (also known as the Battle of Alcácer Quibir) in 1578. Make sure to also go up to the roof for fantastic views over the city. Admission is 10 MAD.\n",
      "One of the best ways to explore the medina is with a local guide. You’ll learn about its history, meet local shopkeepers, and be less likely to get harassed. Guru Walk offers a couple of free walking tours, led by locals. This is a good introduction to the medina, and one of the best ways to deepen your experience. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!\n",
      "Found at the western entrance to the medina, Bab Bou Jeloud is an entrance to the city whose original gate dated to the 12th-century. From here, locals entered the main souq, Tala’a Kebira, and went to the Kairaouine Mosque and University. While the original gate is long gone, today’s gate, decorated with blue and green mosaics, dates to 1913 and is still worth seeing up close.\n",
      "These 14th-century tombs, a royal necropolis from the Marinid Dynasty, are located on a hilltop at the northern edge of the city. While the brick tombs are in ruins today (just a few weathered brick walls and arches remain), the real draw is the panoramic view over the city below. This is also a popular spot to watch the sunset.\n",
      "This former palace was transformed into Morocco’s first museum back in the early 20th century. Today, the collection features over 6,500 objects focused on Moroccan history, archaeology, and traditional arts and crafts. Don’t miss the lush gardens in the inner courtyard, complete with ornamental fountains and mosaic tilework. Admission is 10 MAD. (Temporarily closed for renovations).\n",
      "This small museum focuses on the traditional Moroccan art of woodworking. It is in a beautifully restored 18th-century funduq (travelers inn) with a stunning interior courtyard carved all in wood. The rooms formerly used for traveling merchants now house the museum’s exhibits, where visitors can learn more about the craft. Admission is 20 MAD.\n",
      "Jardin Jnan Sbil is the only real public park in the city. Originally created in the 19th century, the park fell into ruin but was renovated and reopened to the public in 2011. Spanning over 18 acres, there are more than 3,000 species of plants here, with subsections of the park dedicated to different themes, such as the Bamboo Garden or the Andalusian Garden. Admission is free. Open every day except Mondays.\n",
      "Located near the Saffarin Madrasa, this is the oldest tannery in the city. Dating back to the 9th century, the tanneries in Fez are one of the city’s biggest attractions. The leather here is soaked and dyed and then shipped all over the world. There is no fee to enter, but touts will normally charge you around 20-50 MAD to show you the best views (avoid getting ripped off though; some will try and charge upwards of 200 MAD). It can be a bit hard to find so use GPS or hire a guide to show you around.\n",

      "Q: Fez Travel Costs\n",
      "A: Hostel prices – Hostels in Fez are super cheap. Dorms with 6-8 beds cost 85-105 MAD per night. Dorms with 10 or more beds cost 60-80 MAD per night. Private rooms average around 250-320 MAD per night. Hostels usually include free breakfast, Wi-Fi, towels, and linens.\n",
      "Budget hotel prices – Budget hotels start around 260-375 MAD per night. Hotels typically include free Wi-Fi, private bathrooms, and free breakfast. Many hotels have an outdoor pool as well.\n",
      "On Airbnb, private rooms start around 150 MAD per night. Renting apartments and villas start around 280 MAD and are good if you want to stay in a traditional Moroccan home.\n",
      "Food – Moroccan cuisine is a colorful, flavorful mix of Berber, Andalusian, and Mediterranean traditions with a pinch of French and sub-Saharan cuisine to round things out. It is a land of spices, so expect flavorful meals at every turn (the traditional ras el hanout spice mix is composed of 27 different spices). Beef, goat, and lamb are some of the most common meats, usually eaten with couscous. Fish like mackerel and anchovy are also quite common, owing to the country’s location on the coast. Be sure to try pastilla, a pastry filled with meat or seafood.\n",
      "Crepes cost around 10-25 MAD and sandwiches are 20-25 MAD. Tagines, (a slowly simmered, flavorful dish) are 30-80 MAD. A pot of mint tea is around 8 MAD.\n",
      "For fancier sit-down restaurants, expect to pay 80-120 MAD for a meal, with western food on the higher-end (sometimes topping 150-230 MAD per dish). Pizza is popular and goes for around 30-40 MAD. If you want to really splash out, upscale meals (whether tagine or steak) begin at 150 MAD.\n",
      "Fast food (think McDonald’s) costs around 50 MAD for a combo meal. Beer is 25-30 MAD while a latte/cappuccino is 13 MAD.\n",
      "If you cook your own food, expect to pay 200 MAD per week for groceries. This gets you basic staples like pasta, couscous, seasonal produce, and some meat or seafood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Backpacking Fez Suggested Budgets\n",
      "A: If you’re backpacking Fez, my suggested budget is 285 MAD per day. This budget covers staying in a hostel dorm, eating from some street stalls and cooking most meals, walking or taking public transit everywhere, limiting your drinking, and stocking to free and cheap activities like free walking tours and exploring the medina.\n",
      "A mid-range budget of about 505 MAD per day covers a private Airbnb room, eating out for most meals, having a couple of drinks or splurging on a nice meal, taking the occasional taxi to get around, and doing more paid activities like visiting museums and day-tripping to Volubilis.\n",
      "On a “luxury” budget of 940 MAD or more per day, you can stay in a hotel, eat out for all your meals, rent a car for day trips, take more taxis, and do whatever tours and activities you want. This is just the ground floor for luxury though. The sky is the limit!\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Fez Travel Guide: Money-Saving Tips\n",
      "A: Fez, like the rest of Morocco, is very affordable so it’s easy to visit here and save money. That said, here are some ways to save money in Fez:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Where to Stay in Fez\n",
      "A: There several hostels in the city. Here are my recommended places to stay in Fez:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Get Around Fez\n",
      "A: The medina is very walkable (and fun to explore on foot) but it can be confusing to navigate. Bring a guide or use GPS so you don’t get lost.\n",
      "Public transportation – The best way to travel around Fez is via bus. The city has a reliable and cheap local bus system. The standard fare is 2-5 MAD per ride. Be sure to watch out for pickpockets as there are a lot.\n",
      "Taxi – With a base fare of 20 MAD and 6 MAD per kilometer, taking a taxi is generally around 20-40 MAD per ride. Taxis from the airport to the city center cost around 120-150 MAD, while the airport express bus only costs 20 MAD for the same distance.\n",
      "Car rental – Car rentals can be found for as little as 100 MAD per day for a multi-day rental. You don’t need one to get around the city, however, they can be helpful for day trips. Drivers need to be at least 21 years of age. Just be cautious — drivers here are aggressive and accidents are common.\n",

      "Q: When to Go to Fez\n",
      "A: The months between March and May are the best time for visiting Fez, with temperatures reaching an average of 30°C (86°F). These are the shoulder season months so the weather is hot but not unbearable. This is also peak tourist season so expect more crowds (as well as higher prices) throughout the city.\n",
      "July and August are the hottest months, with temperatures an average of 38°C (100°F). It’s too hot to really enjoy the city so skip a summer visit if you can.\n",
      "The Fez Festival of Sufi Culture takes place in October and is a perfect way to listen to Sufi musicians. In June, the Fez Festival of World Sacred Music is a nine-day music festival with Sufi chanters, Iranian whirling dervishes, and dancers from around the globe.\n",
      "Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar (which is lunar-based) and lasts for 30 days. During this time Muslims abstain from food and drink during the daytime. It is also considered a sober month in Morocco.\n",
      "In winter, the daytime temperatures average around 7°C (45°F), and while the days can be sunny, the nights can be quite chilly. Prices are usually a bit lower, but pack a sweater!\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Stay Safe in Fez\n",
      "A: While violent crimes here are rare, there’s a lot of petty crime in Fez. You have to really be on your guard here. Pickpocketing, petty theft, fake tour guides, and harassers are a big problem in the medina. Be firm when saying no to touts who try to sell you excursions. Also, beware of locals inviting you into their shop for tea as you’ll end up being forced to buy something you don’t want and spending a lot of money as well.\n",
      "Women traveling alone attract a lot of attention here and the chances of being followed and possibly groped are high. This is a particular problem in crowded areas like the medina. Always be watchful and trust your gut. Do not bring valuables with you and keep your belongings tight to your body. Dress conservatively and avoid wearing a lot of jewelry.\n",
      "Walking alone at night is generally not a good idea. If you’re unsure about an area, ask the hotel staff which areas are safe.\n",
      "If you’re worried about getting scammed, you can read about common travel scams to avoid here.\n",
      "If you experience an emergency, dial 19 for assistance (112 for mobile phones).\n",
      "Always trust your gut instinct. Avoid isolated areas at night and be aware of your surroundings at all times. Make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID.\n",
      "The most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past.\n",
      "\n",

      "Q: Top 5 Things to See and Do in Marrakesh\n",
      "A: Djemaa el-Fna is Marrakesh’s main square, where you can find exotic street performers, snake charmers, tattoo artists, musicians, storytellers, and more. It’s huge, chaotic, crowded, and a sensory overload. At night, the market fills with food vendors and crowds of locals and tourists alike.\n",
      "La Bahia was built in the late 19th century over the course of 14 years. Although the palace has 150 rooms, only a fraction of it is open to the public. The Grand Riad, with its studded fountains and carved wood lintels, is the oldest part of the palace and probably my favorite part. Entrance is 70 MAD.\n",
      "The Jardin Majorelle was created by French painter Jacques Majorelle between 1886-1962. The garden is a collection of 300 species of plants from five different continents. The entrance fee is 120 MAD and another 30 MAD for the Berber Museum. The new YSL Museum costs an additional 100 MAD.\n",
      "This Quranic learning center dates to the 14th century and is greatly admired for its detailed tile, woodwork, colorful mosaic walls, and Italian marble. The main courtyard has some stunning tile work. Admission costs 70 MAD. Currently closed for renovations.\n",
      "Saadian Sultan Ahmed al-Mansour ed-Dahbi flaunted his extravagance and wealth, as you’ll see at his tombs. This royal necropolis was built in the late 16th century with imported Italian marble and decorated with pure gold. The open-air museum costs 70 MAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Other Things to See and Do in Marrakesh\n",
      "A: The Maison de la Photographie (Museum of Photography) opened when friends Patrick Menac’h, a Parisian, and Hamid Mergani, a Marrakshi, decided to combine their collections of vintage Moroccan photography. Together, they collected 4,500 photos, 2,000 glass negatives, and 80 documents between 1870 and 1950. Works are on display through three floors, organized thematically by content and region. Most photos are also for sale. Entrance is 50 MAD.\n",
      "Marrakesh’s medina, which means “city” or “town” in Arabic, is the historic walled city, with a labyrinth of alleys and stalls upon stalls to peruse. Watch the making and selling of traditional handicrafts, eat some street food, and take in the sights and smells in the historic walled quarter of the city. You’ll find stalls selling merguez sausage, grilled meats, potato tagines, maakouda potato cakes, and so much more. Don’t be afraid to get lost in the alleys and tiny streets. The alleys seem endless, but I found it less intimidating than the medina in Fez.\n",
      "The largest Jewish cemetery in Morocco, Miara Cemetery dates to 1537 and is still in use today. The graveyard is divided into three sections: one for men, another for women, and a third for children. Due to space constraints, there are three layers of burial grounds. This is an excellent historical site and I highly suggest you visit. After visiting the cemetery, wander around the Jewish quarter, which is home to the 15th-century Lazama Synagogue. It’s the last synagogue in the quarter.\n",
      "A hammam is a steam bath popular in North Africa. It used to be the only place where people could bathe because private bathrooms were a luxury only few could afford. They are usually found near mosques or toiletry shops and can be upscale or public (traditional). Public hammams cost about 10 MAD and you need to bring your own scrubbing glove, soap, brush, razor, shampoo, towel, and change of clothing. Hotel hammams provide the necessary kit and usually cost around 300-500 MAD. If you want to try a public hammam, go to Hammam Dar el-Bacha or Hammam Mouassine.\n",
      "This is an institution in Marrakesh. While the food is good, most people come for the architecture and atmosphere. Built in the 1920s, this originally was a café, hotel, and postal relay. Today, the café retains much of its original grandeur with vaulted ceilings, black and white tiled floors, leafy palms, red sofas, and leather chairs. The terrace is a fantastic spot to drink a cold beer. On the weekend, you’ll find locals and expats eating brunch and catching up. The menu is mostly French cuisine, with dishes ranging in price from 80-280 MAD.\n",
      "Marrakesh has a lot of parks, with everything from formal gardens with trees planted in straight rows, to expansive parks, to neighboring palaces, to Yves Saint Laurent’s blue-splashed garden. My favorites are Arsat Moulay Abdeslam Cyber Park (featuring free Wi-Fi), Jardin el Harti (over 80 years old), The Agdal Garden (over 700 acres and next to the Royal Palace), and Lalla Hasna Park (a small park right by the Koutoubia Mosque).\n",
      "Located west of the city center, this botanical garden was established around 1130 by the Almohad Caliphate. The Menara pavilion, with its green pyramid-like roof, is a focal point because of its views of the nearby man-made lake. It was built in the 16th-century during the Saadi dynasty. From the gardens, you can see the Atlas Mountains in the distance. Admission is free.\n",
      "Found in the mellah (Jewish quarter), this museum offers cooking classes twice a day. Each class is around two hours in duration and the menus feature Jewish and Moroccan dishes. Cooking classes are around 500 MAD. You can visit the museum for 60 MAD or 120 MAD with tastings. (Temporarily closed due to COVID-19.)\n",
      "The “Incomparable Palace” is a massive palace of over 300 rooms, built by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in the 16th-century. With the sultan’s death and the decline of the Saadian dynasty, the palace fell into decline, and today the palace is a large-scale ruin. Admire the views over the city, stroll the gardens, descend into the dungeons, and learn more at the small museum inside. World Folklore Days, the biggest folk-dance festival in Africa, takes place in the palace complex each March. Entrance to the palace is 70 MAD.\n",

      "Q: Marrakesh Travel Costs\n",
      "A: Hostel prices – Dorm rooms with 6-8 beds cost around 60-90 MAD per night, while a bed in a room with 10-20 beds costs 40-70 MAD per night. Private rooms cost around 260-380 MAD per night. Hostels usually offer free breakfast, Wi-Fi, towels, linens, and many communal spaces designed for you to meet other travelers.\n",
      "Budget hotel prices – Budget hotels cost around 270-410 MAD per night and include private bathrooms, Wi-Fi, and breakfast.\n",
      "On Airbnb, private rooms start around 200-320 MAD per night. Entire homes/apartments start at around 350-550 MAD per night.\n",
      "Food – Moroccan cuisine is a colorful, flavorful mix of Berber, Andalusian, and Mediterranean traditions with a pinch of French and sub-Saharan cuisine to round things out. It is a land of spices, so expect flavorful meals at every turn (the traditional ras el hanout spice mix is composed of 27 different spices). Beef, goat, and lamb are some of the most common meats, usually eaten with couscous. Fish like mackerel and anchovy are also quite common, owing to the country’s location on the coast. Be sure to try pastilla, a pastry filled with meat or seafood.\n",
      "Food can be cheap in Marrakesh if you eat at the street stalls and local restaurants, especially in the main square. Most hostels include breakfast, but a budget cafe breakfast costs around 25 MAD.\n",
      "Restaurants and street stalls in the souk have affordable and traditional meals such as tagine, grilled fish, and meats for 30-50 MAD. Eating Western food and in fancy restaurants starts at around 150 MAD for a dish and can go as high as 300 MAD.\n",
      "Fast food (think burger and fries) costs around 50 MAD for a combo meal.\n",
      "Beer is around 35 MAD while a latte/cappuccino is around 18 MAD.\n",
      "In the main square, try Cafe Clock, Bakchich Cafe, and PepeNero. Try traditional Moroccan foods such as harira (a soup popular during Ramadan), tajine, and Sfenj (Moroccan style donut).\n",
      "If you cook your own food, expect to pay 200 MAD per week for groceries such as pasta, seasonal produce, and some meat or seafood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Backpacking Marrakesh Suggested Budgets\n",
      "A: If you’re backpacking Marrakesh, my suggested budget is about 230 MAD per day. This budget covers staying in a hostel dorm, eating mostly from cheap street stalls and cooking some meals, walking or taking public transit everywhere, limiting your drinking, and sticking to cheap or free attractions like the botanical gardens.\n",
      "A mid-range budget of about 500 MAD per day covers a private Airbnb room, eating out at cheap restaurants for all your meals, enjoying a few drinks, taking the occasional taxi to get around, and doing more paid activities like museum visits and visiting the palace.\n",
      "On a “luxury” budget of 1,090 MAD per day or more, you can stay in a hotel, eat at nice restaurants for all your meals, drink more, rent a scooter or take a taxi to sites outside the city, and do whatever tours and activities you want. This is just the ground floor for luxury though. The sky is the limit!\n",

      "Q: Where to Stay in Marrakesh\n",
      "A: There several hostels in the city. Here are my recommended places to stay in Marrakesh:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Get Around Marrakesh\n",
      "A: Marrakesh is a very walkable city, but the medina can be confusing, so I recommend using GPS. Outside of the medina, there are a few different methods of transportation that you can use.\n",
      "Public transportation – Bus rides around the city cost 2-5 MAD. Buses are run by Alsa and run from 6am-10pm, with most buses running every 15-20 mins. Bus 1 runs from the Kasbah, through Gueliz, and Bab Doukkala. Bus 11 runs through Bab Doukkala, Djemaa El Fna, and Menara Gardens. Bus 12 runs through Jardin Majorelle, Bab Doukkala, and Hivernage.\n",
      "Scooters/Motorcycles – Scooters and motorcycles are also available for rent around the city, with a half-day scooter rental costing around 180 MAD. You can find rental places near the medina.\n",
      "Taxi – Taxis have a base fare around 7 MAD and cost about 4 MAD per kilometer. Don’t expect to receive change, so pay the exact price and ask to use the meter at the beginning of the ride.\n",
      "A taxi from the airport to the city center runs about 60-100 MAD, while an airport express bus only costs about 30 MAD.\n",
      "Always negotiate the price before getting into the taxi, as prices can inflate quite a bit when you arrive at your destination if you don’t.\n",
      "Car rental – Cars can be rented for as little as 200 MAD per day for a multi-day rental. Drivers need to be at least 21. Unless you’re leaving the city, you don’t need a car to get around — though they can be handy for day trips outside Marrakesh. Just be cautious — drivers here are aggressive and accidents are common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: When to Go to Marrakesh\n",
      "A: March-May and September-November are the best times for visiting Marrakesh. During these months, temperatures average 30°C (86°F) so the weather is hot but not unbearable.\n",
      "July and August are the hottest months, with temperatures an average of 38°C (100°F). That’s just too hot to comfortably explore on foot.\n",
      "Marathon des Sables takes place in Morocco each April. It is a 6-day foot race in the Sahara Desert, one of the toughest races of its kind in the world. In July, the Marrakesh Popular Arts Festival attracts fortune tellers, dancers, snake charmers, and fire-swallowers from all over the world. It’s an interesting distraction from the heat of summer when the crowds of tourists are lower.\n",
      "Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar (which is based on lunar cycles so it varies every year) and lasts for 30 days. During this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink during the daytime. It is also considered a sober month in Morocco. Most restaurants and businesses are still open, but often with reduced hours.\n",
      "In winter, the daytime temperatures average around 7°C (45°F), and while the days can be sunny, the nights can be quite chilly. There are fewer visitors during this time but pack a sweater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How to Stay Safe in Marrakesh\n",
      "A: Marrakesh is fairly safe and the risk of violent crime here is low. Like anywhere else, avoid walking through unfamiliar areas alone at night and beware of pickpocketing and petty theft.\n",
      "Pickpocketing, petty theft, fake tour guides, and harassers are your most likely problems here, especially in the medina. Be firm when saying no to touts who try to sell you excursions. Beware of locals inviting you into their shop for tea, as you may end up spending a lot of money to buy something you don’t want.\n",
      "Women traveling alone can attract a lot of attention, and the chances of being followed, and possibly groped, is high. Walking alone at night is generally not a good idea. Dress appropriately and respectfully. Although Marrakesh is touristy and slightly more liberal, women should still dress modestly to avoid harassment and having to spend money on extra clothing to cover up while there.\n",
      "If you’re worried about getting scammed, you can read about common travel scams to avoid here.\n",
      "If you experience an emergency, dial 19 for assistance (112 for mobile phones).\n",
      "Always trust your gut instinct. Avoid isolated areas at night and be aware of your surroundings at all times. Make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID.\n",
      "The most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past.\n",

      "The medinas are the historic hearts of each city in Morocco, part residential area, part shopping center, part food market. Shops, restaurants, markets, and homes all line the twisting and turning streets in buildings seemingly too close together and too old to stay up much longer. As someone who loves to get lost, the medinas were heaven. Word of caution: The Fez Medina is a bit unsafe, so do not go too far off the beaten path. Stick to streets with lots of people or hire a guide to show you around.\n",
      "The rugged and beautiful Atlas Mountains stretch over 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles), from the West Coast of Morocco all the way to Tunisia. This mountain range is home to Jebel Toubkal, North Africa’s tallest peak at 13,671 feet. You can hike all year round, but the best time is from April to May. The Toubkal Circuit (7 days) and M’Goun Traverse (3 days) are some of the more popular treks.\n",
      "Located near Tinerhir in the High Atlas Mountains, this gorge is one of the most recognized in the world and has become very popular with travelers looking to hike the canyon. It’s a challenging hike and takes around 4 hours but if you’re looking for something truly different and outdoorsy in Morocco, don’t miss out on this. For an even more unique experience, skip the day trip and stay overnight in the nearby village of Ait Baha.\n",
      "The Hassan II Mosque, located in Casablanca, is a huge mosque with a minaret that stands 60 stories. It’s the second-largest mosque in Africa and the seventh-largest in the world. The walls are made of marble and the roof is retractable (the minaret also has a laser that points to Mecca at night). It took thousands of Moroccan artists a total of five years to build this detailed architectural masterpiece. Its mosaics, plaster moldings, marble and stone columns and floors, and wood ceilings are utterly impressive. It is big enough for 105,000 worshipers! Combined entry to the mosque and museum is 140 MAD.\n",
      "Traditional Moroccan food is a blend of Berber, Arabic, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and French cuisine. Many hotels and guesthouses offer cooking classes in the big cities like Marrakesh and Fez. You can buy fresh produce from the local market and then make a traditional dish. Café Clock offers some of the best classes. With locations in Marrakesh, Chefchaouen, and Fez, this Western-influenced café is famous for its gigantic and delicious camel burger (which tastes a lot like spicy shawarma).\n",
      "Located in Rabat, this 12th-century Kasbah is found in the oldest part of the city. The citadel, with its narrow streets of white houses, and a great place to wander around and take some pictures. Its elevation offers beautiful views of the river and ocean.\n",
      "Morocco is extremely popular among surfers. The best time to go is during the winter months when the waves are bigger and more consistent, and the air and water temperature is mild. Head to Taghazout, the most popular surf town, to catch some of the best surf in the country. A week-long stay at a surf camp, including lessons, equipment, accommodation, and airport transfer costs around 5,000 MAD.\n",
      "This major city in northern Morocco is located on the North African coast at the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The city’s location means that many civilizations and cultures have left their mark on Tangiers since at least the 10th century BCE. From 1924-1956, Tangier was an international zone separate from Morocco, and thus became a destination for many European and American diplomats, businessmen, writers, and spies during this time. Don’t miss the Grand Mosque, the Kasbah, and strolling down the beach promenade.\n",
      "Named for its proximity to the Atlas Mountains, Atlas Film Studios in the city of Ouarzazate is the largest film studio in the world, covering more than 322,000 sq ft of the desert. Many big films have been shot here including: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Mummy (1999), Gladiator (2000), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Hanna (2011), and part of the TV series Game of Thrones. Be sure to visit the nearby Ksar of Aït Benhaddou kasbah too! It plays into what people think a ksar (fortified village) should look like. I enjoyed roaming the streets and climbing to the top for the view.\n",
      "A major trading center and the southernmost settlement during Roman times, Volubilis is one of the best-preserved (and least frequented) such ruins in the world. It originally dates to the 3rd century BCE and became the capital of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania, growing even more during Roman rule. I found it empty of tourists, not built up, and open in a way that lets you see the structures up close without being behind ten feet of barriers and jostled by crowds. Most of the city is still unexcavated so the site has a very “Indiana Jones” feel to it. I’ve been to a lot of Roman ruins in my travels, but this one is my favorite. Admission is 70 MAD.\n",
      "Pleasantly stroll the Medina in Meknes without being pestered. Located in Central Morocco, this authentic market sells handicrafts made in Meknes such as embroidery and Meknes “Damascene” ironwork. If the Medinas of Fez and Marrakesh overwhelm you, this is the place to go.\n",
      "Essaouira is located a few hours from Marrakesh on the Atlantic coast and is a popular beach destination for tourists, especially Brits. I loved the relaxed atmosphere of the city, the lack of pushy touts, the sea air, and all the fresh fish. Be sure to visit the wonderful fish market in town, where all the small fishermen sell their day’s catch. Afterward, check out the small fish stalls nearby in the main square where you can enjoy fresh, grilled seafood for cheap.\n",

       "'Overall, Morocco is a safe destination but traveling here requires vigilance. You’re unlikely to ever be in any real physical danger in Morocco, but the petty crime and harassment require you to stay on guard — more so than in other countries.\\nWomen traveling alone attract a lot of attention here and the chances of being followed and possibly groped are high. This is a particular problem in crowded medinas. Always be watchful and trust your gut. Do not bring valuables with you and keep your belongings tight to your body. Dress conservatively and avoid wearing a lot of jewelry.\\nWalking alone at night is generally not a good idea in the cities. If you’re unsure about an area, ask the hotel staff which areas are safe.\\nIf you need a taxi, always arrange the price in advance to avoid getting ripped off.\\nWhen out and about, locals might invite you into their shops or offer to guide you around. Always politely but firmly decline otherwise you might end up getting ripped off.\\nIf you’re worried about getting scammed, you can read about common travel scams to avoid here.\\nIf you experience an emergency, dial 19 for assistance (112 for mobile phones).\\nAlways trust your gut instinct. If a taxi driver seems shady, stop the cab and get out. If your hotel is seedier than you thought, get out of there. Make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID. Forward your itinerary along to loved ones so they know where you are.\\nFor more in-depth coverage of how to stay safe in Morocco, check out this post that answers frequently asked questions and concerns.\\nThe most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past. '"

       "'Though the Royal Palace (Dar al-Makhzen) and gardens are closed to the public, the outside is still worth admiring. The palace was built in the 13th-century by Marinid sultans. A tunnel was constructed leading from the palace to the Grand Mosque, allowing the King to attend prayers in privacy. From Place des Alaouites, take a close look at the gilt bronze doors, and their giant artisan-made brass knockers.\\nRecommended to me by many readers of the site, this Western-influenced café is famous for its gigantic camel burger (which tastes a lot like spicy shawarma). Beyond the burger, the food is excellent here: the burger, green smoothies, and melt-in-your-mouth buttery chicken couscous were so satisfying I ate here twice. And, in the crazy and chaotic medinas of each city, the café provides an oasis of calm, where you can recharge, use Wi-Fi, and cool down with air conditioning. They also offer cooking classes and host regular events. A five-hour class starts at 600 MAD and dishes at the café cost 25-95 MAD.\\nThe Al-Attarine Madrasa was designed as an annex to Kairaouine Mosque. The “school of the perfumers” was founded in 1325 by Abu Said and is located at the entrance of the spice and perfume market in Fez. The building is known to be one of the best examples of architecture from the Marinid period (13th-15th century), with a remarkable courtyard comprised of cedarwood and intricately carved plaster. Its mosaics, carvings, and impeccable detail make it worth the visit. Admission is 20 MAD.\\nJews have a long and complex history in Fez. During the city’s golden age between the 9th and 11th centuries, the Jewish community flourished. Afterward, Jews were expelled and killed. The Jewish Cemetery in Fez is one of the oldest in Morocco, home to thousands of tombs — all of which are stark white. The Habarim Synagogue, located at the far end of the property, is now home to a small museum of old articles, photos, and postcards.\\nBuilt in the late 16th-century, this fort is one of the largest defensive structures in Fez. Today, the fort is known as the Museum of Arms, the first museum in Morocco that specializes in the history of arms. There are around 5,000 pieces in the museum’s collection, dating from prehistory to the 20th-century. Don’t miss the Saadian cannon, which was used during the Battle of the Three Kings (also known as the Battle of Alcácer Quibir) in 1578. Make sure to also go up to the roof for fantastic views over the city. Admission is 10 MAD.\\nOne of the best ways to explore the medina is with a local guide. You’ll learn about its history, meet local shopkeepers, and be less likely to get harassed. Guru Walk offers a couple of free walking tours, led by locals. This is a good introduction to the medina, and one of the best ways to deepen your experience. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!\\nFound at the western entrance to the medina, Bab Bou Jeloud is an entrance to the city whose original gate dated to the 12th-century. From here, locals entered the main souq, Tala’a Kebira, and went to the Kairaouine Mosque and University. While the original gate is long gone, today’s gate, decorated with blue and green mosaics, dates to 1913 and is still worth seeing up close.\\nThese 14th-century tombs, a royal necropolis from the Marinid Dynasty, are located on a hilltop at the northern edge of the city. While the brick tombs are in ruins today (just a few weathered brick walls and arches remain), the real draw is the panoramic view over the city below. This is also a popular spot to watch the sunset.\\nThis former palace was transformed into Morocco’s first museum back in the early 20th century. Today, the collection features over 6,500 objects focused on Moroccan history, archaeology, and traditional arts and crafts. Don’t miss the lush gardens in the inner courtyard, complete with ornamental fountains and mosaic tilework. Admission is 10 MAD. (Temporarily closed for renovations).\\nThis small museum focuses on the traditional Moroccan art of woodworking. It is in a beautifully restored 18th-century funduq (travelers inn) with a stunning interior courtyard carved all in wood. The rooms formerly used for traveling merchants now house the museum’s exhibits, where visitors can learn more about the craft. Admission is 20 MAD.\\nJardin Jnan Sbil is the only real public park in the city. Originally created in the 19th century, the park fell into ruin but was renovated and reopened to the public in 2011. Spanning over 18 acres, there are more than 3,000 species of plants here, with subsections of the park dedicated to different themes, such as the Bamboo Garden or the Andalusian Garden. Admission is free. Open every day except Mondays.\\nLocated near the Saffarin Madrasa, this is the oldest tannery in the city. Dating back to the 9th century, the tanneries in Fez are one of the city’s biggest attractions. The leather here is soaked and dyed and then shipped all over the world. There is no fee to enter, but touts will normally charge you around 20-50 MAD to show you the best views (avoid getting ripped off though; some will try and charge upwards of 200 MAD). It can be a bit hard to find so use GPS or hire a guide to show you around.\\n:'"

       "'Marrakesh is a very walkable city, but the medina can be confusing, so I recommend using GPS. Outside of the medina, there are a few different methods of transportation that you can use.\\nPublic transportation – Bus rides around the city cost 2-5 MAD. Buses are run by Alsa and run from 6am-10pm, with most buses running every 15-20 mins. Bus 1 runs from the Kasbah, through Gueliz, and Bab Doukkala. Bus 11 runs through Bab Doukkala, Djemaa El Fna, and Menara Gardens. Bus 12 runs through Jardin Majorelle, Bab Doukkala, and Hivernage.\\nScooters/Motorcycles – Scooters and motorcycles are also available for rent around the city, with a half-day scooter rental costing around 180 MAD. You can find rental places near the medina.\\nTaxi – Taxis have a base fare around 7 MAD and cost about 4 MAD per kilometer. Don’t expect to receive change, so pay the exact price and ask to use the meter at the beginning of the ride.\\nA taxi from the airport to the city center runs about 60-100 MAD, while an airport express bus only costs about 30 MAD.\\nAlways negotiate the price before getting into the taxi, as prices can inflate quite a bit when you arrive at your destination if you don’t.\\nCar rental – Cars can be rented for as little as 200 MAD per day for a multi-day rental. Drivers need to be at least 21. Unless you’re leaving the city, you don’t need a car to get around — though they can be handy for day trips outside Marrakesh. Just be cautious — drivers here are aggressive and accidents are common.'"
