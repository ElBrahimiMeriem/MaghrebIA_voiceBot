      "Based on Archaeological research, the city is said to have been occupied ever since prehistoric times. Sheltered by the Mogador Island, its port provides a suitable harbor fortified from strong marine winds. By 19th century Essaouira was the first seaport in Morocco, operating with trading volumes twice that of Rabat.\n",

      "The city also functioned as a harbor for Marrakesh. But in 1844 the town was bombarded and briefly occupied by the French Navy which was under the rule of Prince de Joinville. Under the French protectorate, Mogador was the military base and the place for all French major operations. Generally, France had a significant contribution to Essaouira economically and administratively.  In recent years, this location has been a sanctuary for most film directors, due is the photogenic and outstanding atmosphere. It was even included in some episodes of the Game of Thrones.\n",

      "Question: \n",
      "Response: Rissani has a legendary history. Between the 14th and the 18th centuries, Rissani was the location of Sijilmassa, the famed desert capital. It is where fortunes in gold and slaves were traded. Rissani is famous for high quality leather production. It is made from goatskins that are carefully tanned with the use of Tamarisk bark.  Location wise, Rissani was so strategic that the ancestors of the ruling Alawite dynasty, Filali, staged the epic battle to supplant the Saadians. Although only a quarter of the population lives in the 17th century ksar and the modern town constitutes a single street and one square, impacts of the past are still heard in the souqs. The town is a cultural destination in Morocco displaying aesthetic examples of early Moroccan architectural styles and reflected in palaces and temples, such as Ksar Oulad Abdelhalim and Ksar Aber.\n",

      "Question: Azrou Morocco\n",
      "Response: Azrou Morocco is a city to head to relax and free your mind. Take a break from the crowd of the big cities. Visitors are drawn to Azrou for monkeys and fragrant cedar forest trails as well. The town serves as an important Berber market center in the Middle Atlas. In Spring, shaggy woods and meadows burst into flowers, adding to the beauty of the city.   The name Azrou, which means Great Rock, is derived from an isolated outcrop that marks the town’s western boundary. The town is easily accessible from the south side of Place Mohammed V. The big Ennour mosque is a beautiful landmark with its beautiful local cedar.   Weather and Best Time to Visit Azrou  Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 33°F to 86°F and is rarely below 27°F or above 94°F.  The summers are short, dry, warm, and motley clear in Azrou. On the other hand, the winters are long, wet, very cold, and partly cloudy. Throughout the whole year, the temperature ranges from 33°F to 86°F and is rarely below 27°F or above 94°F.  The best time to visit Azrou for hot-weather activities is from early July to late August. Due to humidity, the weather feels nice most of the year, excluding some cold weeks in the winter.   It is a must-see forest if you are in Azrou. The forest has so many dead trees, but the experience is magnificent and chilling. You will also get to see the mountains overlooking Azrou.   Try a local meal while resting from wandering around. Find yourself something delicious to eat which is easy in Azrou. Hit one of these restaurants: Les Delices, Poissons Abdelouafi, and Cafe petrol. They are the best there.   Azrou is famous for monkeys. Don’t miss the monkey watching experience. They are Barbary apes that are so used to humans. They will interact and walk with you around the mountains. Enjoy the company of friendly monkeys. Approach them and feed them nuts, they like it!   You won’t leave without buying something nice to remember the memories. You can buy hand-made local souvenirs from locals around the famous attractions or before you hike around the mountains.   Relax and enjoy the breathtaking 5-hectare touch of nature. Enjoy hiking around the area and experience the amazing views of nature, the trees, flowers, and butterflies. A picnic is recommended to have.   Since Azrou is famous for the magnificent mountains and forests, the best way to live the experience is to trek. Explore the hidden gems of the town as well as the animals of the place.   For an adventurous tour of the mountains and forest of Azro, try staying the night at the camping zone. It is safe as you won’t be alone. Many tourists experience camping as well. Enjoy the sky view and the milky way magnificence.   The people of Azrou are very friendly and nice, just like all places in Morocco. One of the best experiences is to meet new friends and enjoy intimacy among new people. Another perk about the locals is that you get to know the history from them. They also give you tips about the best things you can do while you are in the town.\n",

The plants and trees were also imported to give a European feel to the city. The name Irfane means caves and is taken from the local Amazigh language, Tamazight. Explore the amazing city of Ifrane with our Morocco vacations!   The green park offers a peaceful experience around nature, where visitors can take walks through the forest, spot various bird species, and enjoy the water.   The Lion Sculpture is one of Ifrane’s most photographed landmarks. The sculpture was carved during the Second World War by a German soldier. It is believed that the sculpture is in honor of the last remaining wild Atlas lion, killed close to Ifrane.  Activities like skiing, sledding, and snowboarding are popular at Michlifen Ski Resort, during the winter season. Visitors can enjoy playing in the snow.   Although Irfane’s souk is geared towards local residents, tourists will still be able to find a selection of Moroccan handicrafts like household goods, ornamental items, clothing, spices, and more.   Indeed, Ifrane is one of the most attractive cities in Morocco for its diversity and the opportunity it gives its visitors to experience so many activities.\n",

      "Question: Meknes\n",
      "Response: Morocco’s location in North Africa and at the intersection of Europe and Africa has made it attractive to tourists from all around the world. With beaches on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and the well-known Atlas Mountains, Morocco witnesses an influx of millions of visitors from Europe, Africa, and the rest of the world, every year. Morocco is one of the dream destinations for travelers for its culture, food, and warm people; amongst other reasons. One of the most incredible places in Morocco is the relatively unexplored city of Meknes, an Imperial City.  The impressive Heri es-Souani is a set of buildings that served as the Imperial stables and granaries. The roofless buildings still have arched doorways you can stand under and get some creative photos in!   The Bou Inania Medersa, an Islamic school of learning (medersa), was founded in the 14th century and its architecture stands out because of its beautiful tile decorations. Climbing to the rooftop allows you a scenic view of the medina and the Ville nouvelle.  The Bab Al-Mansour is an exquisitely designed gate between Meknes’ Medina and Imperial City districts and was built in 1732. It is one of North Africa’s finest gateways that has survived through the ages. The gateway was never intended for usage, but only to be displayed to visitors - and it is not difficult to see why it may have been something to be proud of! The Bab Al-Mansour is a stunning structure, with intricately carved designs and tile-work, which was representative of architectural design in Morocco at the time.  The Dar Jamai was built in the 19th century and was converted to the Museum of Moroccan Art in 1920. It was initially the residence of the elite Jamai family and their affluence is evidenced in the painted wood and interior plaster of the interiors, which were typical of wealth. There is also a beautiful Andalusian-style inspired garden outside. Today, the museum showcases some of the most incredible arts and crafts of the Moroccan region.   You can also visit the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, which is where the tomb of Sultan Moulay Ismail has been placed, but the mosque is not open to non-Muslims. However, you can still enter the tomb hall and the outer parts of the complex, and witness a breathtaking display of religious decorations.   If you are a fan of even the darker aspects of historical kingdoms, you can visit the slightly eerie Habs Qara, the low-ceilinged underground chamber that was used to keep prisoners.  Other than seeing the historical buildings, walking around the markets of Meknes can introduce you to a vibrancy like no other, as you walk through local markets selling you colorful varieties of fruits, vegetables, and dates. Or you can visit the souks and buy colorful lamps, carpets and so on. You can also take a caleche ride across the city, which is a horse-drawn carriage taking you around the city. When visiting Meknes, you must prepare to be amazed, as you observe and take in historical wonders, while also gorging on local delicacies and shopping for regional souvenirs. A delight for tourists, Meknes is definitely a destination you want to visit once in your lifetime!\n",

      "Response: \n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Question: \n",
      "Response: Morocco has four Imperial Cities, namelyFes,Marrakesh, Meknes, andRabat, of which Meknes is the quietest one. It is less than an hour’s drive away from Fes, its chaotic brother, and has always been the most reclusive of all the Imperial Cities of Morocco. In spite of being quieter, it is a vibrant city, composed of the old (medina) and the new (ville nouvelle). The medina and the ville nouvelle offer to a traveler a striking contrast just three miles apart, with the medina hosting historical wonders and the ville nouvelle boasting of modern splendor.  In the 17th century, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismaël decided to make Meknes one of the most beautiful and powerful Imperial cities in Morocco. And still, today, protected by around 40km of walls, it has preserved imposing monuments, including numerous mosques which earn it its nickname of the \"city of a hundred minarets\".  The city gets its name from the tribe ‘Meknessa’, which predominantly inhabited Eastern Morocco in the 8th century and was founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids and was treated as a military settlement; and later went on to become a capital under Sultan Moulay Ismail, who founded the great Alawite Dynasty. The way the entire city was built was influenced by the Spanish-Moorish style of architecture and has a fascinating blend of Islamic and European styles, which is evidenced through the high walls with grand doors. Its grandeur inspires the wonder of all those who visit the hill-top city today and is reflective of the architectural prowess of its creators.  Meknes was declared a UNESCO World-Heritage Site in 1996 and its beauty has been carefully and delicately preserved. Even the building of the urban parts of the city sees a blend of Islamic and European architectural styles.\n",

      "Response: The major landmark of Morocco Built in the sixteenth century, El Badi Palace was once a standing wonder. However, the palace has left us terraces to follow and explore how magnificent it is. It was built by the sultan Ahmed al-Mansour to commemorate the victory of the Battle of the Three Kings against the Portuguese.      Summer pavilions are situated on each side of the courtyard. The foundations were the only to survive the Crystal Pavilion to the east.  On the opposite side, there is a monumental hall, which was named the Koubba el Hamsiniya (means The Fifty Pavilion), after its size in cubits. It was used by the sultan on occasions.   Accessed only to the right of the building housing the minbar, lie ruins of the palace stables, south to the courtyard. A series of dungeons were once used as a state prison into the last century, leading towards the wall of the present royal palace.   West of the pavilion, there is the room that houses the Koutoubia minbar (prayer pulpit). Made of cedarwood, the  Koutoubia minbar was once the minbar of the Koutoubia Mosque. The minbar is encrusted with marquetry and small writing in gold and silver calligraphy, made by artisans during the twelfth century.  Members of the public are not normally allowed to walk all the way around the minbar to explore the surviving work. However, the guardian may let you if you show huge interest. Photography is not usually allowed there.\n",

During Al Mansour reign, El Badi Palace was magnificent in the western Muslim world. However, now only the palace’s courtyard, which has four sunken gardens and reflecting pools, reflects its majesty.  Unlucky few remains of the palace are standing up till the moment, you can visit the esplanade carved gardens, stories were told about the richness of those gardens with trees and spices in addition to the enclosure wall that once stood encircling the garden.  In 1696, Sultan Moulay Ismail acquired the luxurious pieces of the palace to be added to the imperial city, Meknes.\n",

Let’s dive deeper into the structure of the Badi Palace...   Originally, the entrance of the palace was in the southeast part of the whole complex. Today, the entrance is from the north, through the Green Pavilion. Then it emerges into the central court of the complex which is 130m long and almost as wide.  In the northeast part, tourists can climb up to get a sight from the ramparts, and even a closer view of the storks that nest atop them.  The central court consists of four sunken gardens, divided as two on the northern side and two on the southern side.  Pools play as a separation of the two gardens on each side. There are further four smaller pools in each corner of the court, constructed on a substructure of vaults to allow the circulation of water through the pools and gardens.  When the pools are filled with water, the sight becomes incredibly majestic.\n",

As a result, some people remained supporters of the music, while some did not. This caused confusion in the village, as it was no longer clear which houses would approve these performances and which would not.  Nowadays, a charity is created to provide a space for the pre-festival fun-raising. The annual desert festival of Gnawa, known as Sadaka is held every summer.
